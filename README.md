# Wikipedia-Language-Classification


## How to run:
```
git clone https://github.com/shalayiding/Wikipedia-Language-Classification
bash run.bash
```

## How to run.bash:
  This file is simple bash scrip :
  put every thing in one file and run it, it will generate the data set and do two different learning algorithm on same data
  and print the result of how good the leaning algorithm is.

## How to train.py :
  train.py take 3 different argvment:
  first -> sample file name forexample : sample.dat (data set contain informaiton need to be learn)
  second -> hypothesisOut buffer that store the data information (buffer file )
  third -> type of the learning algorithm ("ada" or "dt")
  warning :  if the givin train data or test data contain some odd character it might break the program in that case just use the 
  data set randomly generated by extract_data.py 
  exp : python3 train.py sample.dat hypothesisOut ada
    
## How to predict.py:
  predict.py take 2 different argvment
  first -> the hypothesisOut buffer that generated by train.py (train.py has to come first )
  second -> the data we need to testing on (different from train data)
  exp : python3 predict.py hypothesisOut sample_test.dat 

## How to extract_data.py:
  The main job of the py file is to make a train set and test set from same type of data:
  the program require 6 different file inorder to work:
  1-> the dutch file contain raw dutch text
  2-> the english file contain raw english text 
  3-> the file to out put the sample which is data for trainning 
  4-> the file to out put the test data which we do test on 
  5-> the correct result of the test data
  6-> the percentage you want to split the data : i give as 80% train and 20% test on default on scrip
  exp : python3 extract_data.py 300_train.nl 300_train.en sample.dat sample_test.dat result.dat

## How to compare.py :
  This file only need 2 file argvment:
  1-> input file that is correct result of orginal test case
  2-> input file that is prediction result generated by learning algorithm
  exp : python3 compare.py result.dat predic_result.dat
