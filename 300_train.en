before writer-director philip kaufman brought tom wolfe's book the right stuff to the big screen in 1983, onscreen astronauts were little more than alien quarry or asteroid bait. in kaufman's hands, however, spaceflight became a far more human pursuit—a story not of external threats but inner resolve. with its three-hour-plus run time and unconventional structure, the film—which tells the story of test pilots like chuck yeager and gordon cooper as they break the sound barrier and launch toward the exosphere—was almost as daring as its subject. (kaufman calls it “the longest movie ever made without a plot.”) but it introduced an entire cinematic genre, what quentin tarantino has called the “hip epic,” inspiring everyone from michael bay to james cameron, who hired its cinematographer for titanic. its dialog has become a go-to signifier of human accomplishment; director rian johnson celebrated landing his star wars gig by tweeting a clip from the movie. “phil really pulled it off,” george lucas says. none other than christopher nolan has called it “an almost perfect movie.”

making it was an epic in itself. its locations were hard-earned; its special-effects plan was largely reconceived during production; one man lost part of an ear on the set, another lost his life. but more than three decades later, the right stuff still resonates, a testament to the incredible feats of bravery, sacrifice, and intelligence of which humans are capable—and to the inherent absurdity of climbing into tin cans mounted on ballistic missiles and blasting into space. chuck yeager (retired general, u.s. air force): tom wolfe started writing a book about the astronauts' early days. through that, he discovered the air force test pilots who were doing the nitty-gritty work. we weren't getting free houses or notoriety. george lucas: i was born and raised in the bay areaCHAPTER ONEThe end of school daysI am John Ridd, a farmer of the village of Oare in Somerset, and I have a story to tell you. It is about some things that happened to me in my younger days.On the 29th November 1673, when I was twelve years old, John Fry, a worker from our family's farm, came to collect me from my school at Tiverton. He rode his horse up to the gate, leading my own little horse behind him. He was two weeks early, so I knew something was wrong.'What are you doing here, John?' I asked him. 'It's not the holidays yet.'He would not look at me. 'Oh, I know that, young Master Ridd. But your mother has saved the best apples, and cooked some wonderful cakes - all for you.''And Father? How is Father?' I said. It was usually Father who came to collect me, and it was strange that John Fry hadn't said anything about him.'Oh, he's very busy on the farm just now,' he said. But John wasn't his usual self, and I knew this was a lie.When I had packed my bags and said goodbye to my friends, I got on my horse and we started the journey home.It was a long journey from Tiverton to Oare, and in places the road was very bad. John Fry still would not tell me why he had come to collect me, or answer my questions about Father. He looked unhappy about something, but I tried to hope for the best, as boys always do.On the hill at the end of Dulverton town, we saw a big coach with six horses. In the front seat of the coach sat a foreign-looking woman, and next to her was a little dark-haired girl. I could see from the girl's soft skin that she was from a rich family, and I felt too shy to look at her more than once. She didn't look at me at all. Opposite them sat a very beautiful lady, in fashionable clothes, and next to her was a little boy, who was about two or three years old. The woman in the front, I thought, must be the servant of the family. I always remembered the family after wards, because I had never seen people who were so grand, and so rich.After Dulverton, the road got worse and worse, and soon we came into a very dangerous part of the country. This was Exmoor, a place of high, wild hills and deep valleys, and on Exmoor lived a family of robbers called the Doones. Everyone was afraid of them. They had robbed and murdered on Exmoor for many years, and had grown very strong. Now it was getting dark, and a fog was coming down. It was just the kind of night when the Doones would be out - and we were coming near to the path that they always used.I wanted to ride fast, and cross the Doone path as quickly as possible, but John Fry knew better.'Go slowly and quietly,' he said, 'if you want to see your home again.'But when we came to the valley where the Doone path was, we heard the sound of horses.'Hide!' said John, and we rode our horses off the path, and hid. But I wanted to look at the Doones, and went up onto a hill above the path. From there I saw a frightening sight.Below me, moving quietly, were thirty horsemen. They were heavy, strong men, like all the Doones, and they were dressed for battle, carrying guns. Tied to their horses were all the things they had stolen. Some had sheep or other animals. But one man had a child across his horse - a little girl. She had on a very expensive dress, and I thought it was probably for this that the Doones had stolen her. I could not see whether she was alive or dead, but the sight of that child made me sad, and angry.When we got home to the farm, my father did not come out to meet us, not even when the dogs ran up and made a lot of noise. 'Perhaps he has visitors,' I thought, 'and is too busy to come out.' But really I knew this was not true. I went away and hid. I didn't want anyone to tell me anything. I heard my mother and sister crying when they came out to find me, but I could not look at them.Later they told me everything: my father had been killed. He had been murdered by the Doones.It happened on his way back from the market at Porlock, on a Saturday evening. He was riding with six other farmers, and the Doones stopped them and asked them for their money. The other farmers passed their money over at once, but my father was brave. He rode at them, waving his long stick above his head. He managed to hit quite a few heads, but one Doone was waiting at the side of the road with a gun, and shot him.Although we knew it was the Doones who had killed my father, it was useless even to ask the local judges or law officers to do anything about it. They were afraid of the robbers, too - or were even helping them. The Doones did almost anything they wanted on Exmoor.They were not local people. They came from the north of England, where their leader. Sir Ensor Doone, had been a rich man, with a lot of land. But he argued with his cousin, the Earl of Lorne, who had even more land, and because of the trouble he caused, the King took away nearly everything that Sir Ensor owned. A proud, angry man. Sir Ensor refused to make peace with his cousin, and without his land and farms he
